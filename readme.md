a collection of notebooks exploring a term loans dataset.

## description

this project contains four models: classification, regression, clustering and nlp.

* classification: a tree based classifier using loan applicant data to predict whether they will default on their loan.
* regression: a tree based regressor using loan applicant data to predict the funds the lender can expect to recover should the borrower default.
* clustering: a k-means clustering of the dataset into 7 clusters.
* nlp: a natural language processing model, predicting the purpose of the applicant's loan using the desciption entered during their application.
